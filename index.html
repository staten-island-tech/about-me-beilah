    <p id="bodyKiki">I have a 18 month old Scottish straight. Her name is Kiki, and she likes eating. For breakfast, she'll have caviar with a side of poached egg yolks. For lunch, she enjoys steamed chicken breast in clear soup. For dinner, she eats no dinner because she's dieting. My disowned child, Hailey Lan, is rebellious and ran away somewhere. She is now my opp. Attached is her mugshot when she was caught stealing at a gas station.</p>
